About this package
------------------

Using data from long reads obtained by Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing makes genome assembly easier, in particular to solve repeats and structural variants, in prokaryotic as well as in eukaryotic genomes, resulting in increased contiguity and accuracy.

Bunch of softwares and tools are released or updated every week, and a lot of species see their genome assembled using those.

Thatâ€™s right.

"\ *But which assembly tool could give the best results for my favorite organism?*\ "

**CulebrONT can help you!** CulebrONT is an open-source, scalable, modulable and traceable snakemake pipeline, able to launch multiple assembly tools in parallel and providing help for choosing the best possible assembly between all possibilities.
